#**USER MANUAL** 
To start, if there are no .txt files that are already generated, then make sure you run 
the first few lines of code to generate the .txt files. You should do this because
then in the future, it will take less time to load the data since it does not have to scrape
the internet each time.

Once you have the .txt files made, you can now run the main method normally. It
could take a while to generate the graphs so be patient while 
the graph is being created.
 
Once the graph is built, you are now able to enter two artist that you would like to see
the link between within the Billboard artist graph. If at any time you wish to exit the program,
you are able to type "EXIT" to exit the program. If not, pay close attention to the format of the user input
in order to not run into an error. Please keep in mind that capitalization matters for the artists--capitalize
the names of artists as they would usually appear (such as on Spotify or the Billboard website).

If the program runs correctly, the output will look something like this:
