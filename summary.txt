Project Name: Hot or Not
Project Members: Ria Kulkarni and Christian Sun

Project Description: The point of this project is to be able to see the connections between two artists
through a graph. It outputs the shortest path using BFS to see the link between two artists and the
songs that could help them get the connection between the two artists. To do this, we scraped the Billboard
top charts from the start of the Billboard Top Charts, created a graph between the artists and the songs,
and performed BFS to find the connections between each of the artist combinations (if there exists one).

Categories: Graph and Graph Algorithms, Information Networks.

Why Project Differs from Proposal: Our project idea was to test how accurate different
 “Top Songs” charts are. For example, the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart or the Spotify Viral 100.
 We want to do this by comparing each ranking to how frequently each of those songs are mentioned on
 Twitter. This way we could have gotten an idea of how much “buzz” each of the songs have and
 see which one is the most accurate. However, we ran into many roadblocks with this project proposal
 because we could not get a Twitter API and when we tried to use Google Trends to see what people
 were talking about, it would limit us at 5 songs, which was inefficient. We decided to keep the theme
 of Billboard Top Songs but instead of comparing it to what people were talking about, we decided
 to create a graph to see teh connections between different artists because that did not require any
 API.
